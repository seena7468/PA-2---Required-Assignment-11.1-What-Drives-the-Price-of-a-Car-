### Problem statement:
Our goal is to understand the key factors that influence the price of used cars in your inventory. Using a dataset of vehicle listings, we have applied data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical modeling to identify which attributes—such as age, mileage, condition, and brand—drive value.

### Data:
The data is in a structured, tabular format. The dataset contains 426,880 individual records (rows), each representing a used car listing. There are 18 attributes (columns) for each record.

#### Identities of the Fields
The dataset contains the following 18 fields and their respective data types:

id (int64): A unique numerical identifier for each listing.
region (object): The geographical region of the listing.
